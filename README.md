# JAM

The proposed project is a user-hosted trivia web application. This application aims to create an interactive quiz-based learning experience, taking its inspiration from the popular game-based learning platform, ‘Kahoot!’. Designed for students, teachers, trainers or simply anyone who wants to challenge their friends to a quiz, the extent of the web application’s features allow anyone to quickly create and host a quiz-based session and let others join in and participate. Thus, within a session, there will exist a host user who creates the trivia while the participants joining voluntarily act as players. The players will use the quiz ID given by the host to join a particular session.
